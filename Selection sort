SELECTION SORT

Introduction:

Selection sort is a simple sorting algorithm. This sorting algorithm is an in-place comparison-based algorithm in which the list is divided into two parts, the sorted part at the left end and the unsorted part at the right end. Initially, the sorted part is empty and the unsorted part is the entire list.

The smallest element is selected from the unsorted list and swapped with the leftmost element, and that element becomes a part of the sorted list. This process continues moving unsorted list boundary by one element to the right.

This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst case complexities are of ÎŸ(n2), where n is the number of items.

Algorithm:

1) Take the list's first element as minimum.
2) Search the minimum element in the list
3) Swap with value at location minimum
4) Increment minimum to point to the next element
5) Repeat until the list gets sorted

Example:

[6,4,5,3,7,1]

[1,4,5,3,7,6]

[1,3,5,4,7,6]

[1,3,4,5,7,6]

[1,3,4,5,7,6]

[1,3,4,5,6,7]
